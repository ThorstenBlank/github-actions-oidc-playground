# github-actions-oidc-playground
Playground to test the new GitHub Actions Feature: Secure cloud deployments with Open ID Connect.

This code was based on the [blog article of Aidan Steele](https://awsteele.com/blog/2021/09/15/aws-federation-comes-to-github-actions.html).

The feature is currently on the [GitHub Roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/249).
